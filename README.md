DESCRIPTION: [Task - 2]

Developed a real-time chat application utilizing Socket.IO a JavaScript library that enables real-time, bi-directional communication between web clients and servers. Developed a live chat system where users can join, send messages and interact in real time with others. This application will demonstrate full-stack development skills by integrating a responsive frontend with a Node.js backend using WebSockets for seamless, event-driven communication.

Objective:
Built a functioning chat application that supports live messaging using WebSockets facilitated through Socket.IO. This app allows multiple users to connect, send and receive messages instantly, and reflect these interactions across all connected clients in real time. This project highlights the power of real-time systems and is essential for understanding the basics of scalable communication technologies used in modern web applications like Slack, Discord, and WhatsApp Web.

Key Features:

1. Real-Time Messaging with Socket.IO:
   This app utilize Socket.IO on both the server and client sides to maintain a persistent connection and deliver real-time messages. Messages sent by one user instantly appear on all other connected clients without refreshing the page.

2. User Connection and Disconnection:
   When a user connects or disconnects, a system message is broadcasted to all other users to indicate the user's activity.

3. Frontend Design:
   The frontend is user-friendly and responsive, designed using HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React. Key components of the UI include:

   * A chat window displaying all messages in chronological order
   * A message input field and a send button

4. Backend Implementation:
   The backend is developed using Node.js and Express.js for routing with Socket.IO to handle real-time communication. The server will:

   * Manage socket connections and disconnections
   * Broadcast messages to all connected clients

7. Error Handling and Input Validation:
   The application include basic error handling to manage issues such as empty message submissions or connection failures. The server sanitize inputs to avoid malicious content or script injections.

Deliverables:

* A fully working chat application with a responsive frontend and Socket.IO-powered backend.
* Live messaging with real-time updates across clients.
* UI that supports message display and message input.
* Organized codebase with proper comments and modular structure.

Technology Stack:

* Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript and React
* Backend: Node.js, Express.js
* Real-time Communication: Socket.IO

Evaluation Criteria:

* Real-time message delivery using WebSockets
* Stable frontend and backend integration
* Responsiveness and user experience of the UI
* Proper user connection/disconnection management
* Code quality and modularity
